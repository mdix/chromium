Google Chromium is a browser that combines a minimal design with sophisticated
technology to make the web faster, safer, and easier.

This version, compiled from source, solves the crashes which happen when
Slackware users try to upload JPEG files. The problem happens with other
Chrome/Chromium packages, which are in fact DEB/RPM packages repacked as
Slackware packages.

Dependencies: GConf, gnome-keyring, libevent, libtasn1, Orbit2, yasm 

The above dependencies have to be compiled in this order:

1-ORBit2
2-GConf
3-libtasn1
4- gnome-keyring

*- libevent and yasm can be compiled first, last or between those, no problem.
